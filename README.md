# Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Data
This project implements a machine learning–based sentiment analysis system to classify social media text (Twitter comments) into positive and negative sentiments using Python and supervised learning techniques.


## Overview 
Sentiment analysis helps understand public opinion by analyzing textual data.  
In this project, Twitter comments are processed and classified using traditional machine learning and NLP techniques.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- NLP (Tokenization, Stop-word removal, Stemming)
- TF-IDF Vectorization

## Project Workflow
1. Data Collection
2. Text Preprocessing (Cleaning, Tokenization, Stop-word removal, Stemming)
3. Feature Extraction using TF-IDF
4. Model Training using Logistic Regression (supervised learning)
5. Model Evaluation using Accuracy , Confusion Matrix  and classification report

## Results
The model achieved approximately 80% accuracy on the test dataset(unseen data).

## Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Experimenting with Deep Learning models (LSTM, BERT)
